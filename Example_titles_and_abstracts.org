** Open Science - Principles, approaches and incentives

(for a seminar, 2018-02-15, Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, SFB1170, University of Würzburg, by Konrad Förstner)

Open science is an umbrella term for several recent developments like
open access publishing, open research data and open research software
that all aim to improve the scientific process in different
dimensions. In order to understand these open approaches we will
discuss the state of the current research cycle and what actually is
good scientific practice. We will reflect and discuss how recent
trends and new technologies can and should influence how we perform
research and communicate science to the society. We will also discuss
the required incentives that drive this change and have a look at the
perspective of funding bodies like the DFG as well as the universities.
