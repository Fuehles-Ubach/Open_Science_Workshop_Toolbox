** Open Science - Principles, approaches and incentives

(for a seminar, 2018-02-15, Faculty of Physic and Astronomy, University of Würzburg, by Konrad Förstner)

Open science is an umbrella term for several recent developments like
open access publishing, open research data and open research software
that all aim to improve the research process in different
dimensions. In order to understand these open approaches we will
discuss the state of the current research cycle and what actually is
good scientific practice. We will reflect and discuss how recent
trends and new technologies can and should influence how we perform
research and communicate science. We will also discuss the required
incentives that drive this change and have a look at the perspective
of the funding bodies like DFG as well as universities.
