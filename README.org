#+TITLE: The Open Science Workshop Toolbox
#+AUTHOR: Konrad U. Förstner and Andreas Leimbach

* About 

This is a small (opiniated) collection of topics and
methods used when running Open Science workshop. We have used them in
several occassion for workshops in diverse settings (mostly for a
scientific audience).

* Adapt to the audience

Adapt the material to the audience, e.g. students or seasoned researchers.

* Important points to make

- Open Science = Real Science (Good Scientific practice)
- Open the **whole** research cycle

* Icebreaker (questions)

Used to relax the audience, so that they are more open for the following discussion.

- Organize audience by
	- research field
	- career state (student, PhD, postdoc) or time being in science
- Who has tried to replicate a research paper but not able to do so? If no, why did it not work?
- Who has used free online teaching resources
- Who has found useful information on a scientific blog, Twitter etc.
- What was the longest time you had a manscript under peer review?
- Who couldn't access a publication because of closed access
- Who had problems acquiring published data

* Use the research cycle as frame work to develop ideas with audience

- Idea -> Develop plan -> Fund -> Data generation -> Data analysis -> Publish (submission, peer review) -> ...

* What can **you** do right now?

- Use/promote
	- open access journals
	- preprint servers (and publish freely accessible post-prints, e.g. [[http://dissem.in]])
	- data repositories for your research data
- Document and release code
- Use the reviewing process to promote open science (e.g. “The Open Science Peer Review Oath”)
- Interact with colleagues and public via social media (blogs, Twitter etc.)
- Integrate Open Science in your classes (e.g. “The Open Science and Reproducible Research course”)
- Do replication studies with students: Data available?, Code available and usable?, Methods detailed enough?
- Organize Trainings: Software/Data/Library Carpentry, Hackathons etc.
- Abandon the broken "journal prestige" system to influence university administration on matters of research evaluation and tenure (e.g. Felix Schönbrodt University of Munich, [[http://www.nicebread.de/open-science-hiring-practices/]]), and on grant panels and editorial boards
