#+TITLE: The Open Science Workshop Toolbox
#+AUTHOR: Konrad U. Förstner and Andreas Leimbach

* About 

This is a small (opiniated)  collection collection of topics and
methods used when running Open Science workshop. We have used them in
several occassion for workshops in diverse settings.

* Adapt to the audience

* Important points to make

- Open Science = Real Science (Good Scientific practice)

* Icebreaker

- Organized by research field 
- Who has tried to replicate a research paper but not able to do so?

* Use the research cycle as frame work

- Idea -> Develop plan -> Fund -> Data generation -> Analysis -> Publishing -> ...
